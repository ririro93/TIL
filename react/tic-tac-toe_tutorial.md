# tic-tac-toe tutorial

## Immutability
> it's import because
1. complex features become simple
    - ex). tic-tac-toe time travel
2. detect changes
    - check if new object is same with previous one
3. determine when to re-render in react
    - ex). shouldComponentUpdate()
    - cf). pure components

## Function component
> simpler way to write components
- no state
- only takes props as input and returns render
